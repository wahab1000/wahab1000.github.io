# About Section
about_content: | # Description about yourself
  Hi, my name's Wahab Faizi, and I am a second-year Electrical & Electronic Engineering student at Queen Mary University of London, aspiring to build a career in software engineering. With a strong academic background (projected first-class degree), hands-on software development experience, and extracurricular leadership roles, I am focused on merging technical engineering skills with practical software solutions.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python (Flask)</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, and <mark>HTML</mark>. I also have experience working with front-end and back-end frameworks to build data-driven applications, as well as leadership experience through co-founding the Circuit Design Society at my university.

  I am passionate about contributing to impactful projects, continuously learning, and applying my skills to real-world problems, particularly in software engineering and electrical systems.

          As part of my software developer internship at UCL, I worked on the backend and frontend of the CogStack Catalogue app, an application for requesting healthcare data. I improved the backend performance using Flask and SQL, optimized data queries, and added front-end features using HTML for better user interaction. In the presentation, I describe briefly all the tasks I completed during my internship.

  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | 
      Outside of engineering, I am actively involved in martial arts, training and competing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Judo. These sports have greatly improved my problem-solving, discipline, and decision-making skills.

      I strive to be a key member of my community. I have organized three charity sports tournaments at my local youth center, and I am currently working with cultural societies at university to organize a charity 5K run. Leadership and community engagement have always been at the heart of my personal values, which is why I held roles such as House Captain during my school years.
